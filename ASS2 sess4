class Parent{
private void method1(){
 System.out.println ("Parent's method1()");
}
public void method2() {
 System.out.println ("Parent's method2()");
method1();
}
}




 class Child extends Parent {
 public void method1() {
 System.out.println ("Child's method1()");
} 

public static void main(String args[]) {
Parent p = new Child();
p.method2();
}}





EXPECTED OUTPUT:
C. Prints : Parent's method2()
 Parent's method1()


BECAUSE WHEN IT CALLS METHOD 2 WHICH IS PUBLIC THE FIRST LINE IN METHOD2 GETS PRINTED AND IT
IS CALLING METHOD1 WHICH IS PRIVATE SO ITS GET PRINTED IN NEXT LINE.
